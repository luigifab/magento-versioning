# versioning

A module to automatize the updates using GIT for Magento 1.

For more information, go to https://www.luigifab.fr/magento/versioning (IPv6 is required, it's not a joke). No IPv6? It's possible to get an IPv6 on an IPv4 thanks to *Miredo*. Run `sudo apt-get install miredo` and `sudo service miredo force-start`.

This repository is a mirror. To install the module, please use the extension key available in the documentation.
